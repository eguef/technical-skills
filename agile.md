# Agile Process
### Expectation
The Developer knows how to run daily stand ups, sprint planning sessions and retrospectives.

### Justification
On my current engagement, I have been able to acquire this skill as it is a routine on my team to take turns in anchoring daily standups, sprint planning and retrospectives. We run daily standups where each team member give updates about his/her current task and also state their blockers if any. We also have weekly sprint planning meetings, demo meetings and monthly retrospectives.

### Notes

#### Sprint Planning

1. What is sprint planning ?
  *Sprint planning is an event in the scrum framework where the team determines the product backlog items they will work on during that sprint and discusses their initial plan for completing those product backlog items.*

2. What happens during the sprint planning process ?
  *During the sprint planning, the product owner describes the highest priority features to the team. The team asks enough questions that they can turn high-level user story of the product backlog into more detailed tasks of the sprint backlog.*

#### Sprint Retrospective

1. What is a sprint retrospective ?
  *The sprint retrospective occurs at the end of the sprint. This is an opportunity for the team to improve and all members should be in attendance.*

2. what happens during a sprint retrospective ?
  *During the sprint retrospective, the team discusses, What went well in the sprint, what could be improved and what will we commit to improve in the next sprint, the team plans ways to increase product quality by improving work processes or adapting the definition of `done`.*

  *By the end of the sprint retrospective, the team should have identified improvements that it will implement in the next sprint.*

#### Burndown Chart

1. What is a burndown chart ?
  *A burndown is a chart that shows how quickly you and your team are burning through your user stories. It shows the amount of work that has been completed in an epic or sprint nad the total work remaining. Burndown charts are used to predict your team's likelihood of completing their work in the time available. They're also great for keeping the team aware of any scope creep that occurs.*

2. Why is a burndown chart important ?
  *Burndown charts are a way to visually represent progress achieved within the sprint. They depict the amount of work accomplished versus the amount of time left to go. The vertical axis represents the work left to be done and the horizontal axis represents the time left for the completion of an iteration/sprint/epic.*

#### Technical debt

1. What is a technical debt ?
  *Technical debt is a concept used to effectively communicate the need for refactoring and improvement tasks related to the source code or it's achitecture.*

2. Why is it important to understand the importance of technical debt?
  *If you are able to estimate roughly the time needed for fixing what is not right into your code, the principal of your debt, you could compare this information to other project data, like remaining days before your release dat. This estimation will help you to understand your situation and plan repayment activities.*

3. What incurs technical debt ?
  *Code that is not quite right may include many types of issues. These issues may be related to architecture, structure, duplication, test coverage, comments and documentation, potential bugs, complexity, code smells, coding practices and style. All these issues incur technical debt because they have a negative impact on productivity.*
